These options include:\n\n* **-max_displacement:** This option specifies the maximum distance that an instance can be moved during placement.\n* **-disallow_one_site_gaps:** This option disables one-site gaps during placement checking.\n* **-report_file_name:** This option specifies the file name for saving the placement report.\n\nThe `detailed_placement` command is an important part of the OpenROAD flow, as it ensures that instances are placed in a legal and efficient manner.\n\n\nSources:\n",

It is a module within the OpenROAD project that is responsible for generating a clock tree for a design. \n\nHere are some key aspects of CTS:\n\n* **Based on TritonCTS 2.0:** The CTS module in OpenROAD utilizes the TritonCTS 2.0 engine, which performs on-the-fly characterization, eliminating the need to create separate characterization data.\n* **On-the-fly characterization:** This feature allows TritonCTS 2.0 to determine the characteristics of the clock tree during the synthesis process, making it more efficient.\n* **Customization:**  The `configure_cts_characterization` command allows users to adjust certain key parameters of the characterization process, such as maximum slew and capacitance, and the number of steps they are divided into. \n* **`clock_tree_synthesis` command:** The `clock_tree_synthesis` command initiates the actual clock tree generation. It offers various options for controlling the tree's structure, including specifying buffer types, distances between buffers, and clustering settings. \n* **Report generation:** The `report_cts` command allows users to extract useful metrics from the synthesized clock tree, including the number of clock roots, inserted buffers, clock subnets, and sinks. \n\n\nSources:\n",

          "The Automatic Code Generator is a tool for generating code for OpenDB objects and Iterators. \n\nHere are the steps involved in using the Automatic Code Generator:\n\n* **Provide input JSON:** The tool requires a JSON file (schema.json) specifying the requirements for code generation.\n* **Specify source directory:** You must indicate the directory containing the source files for the code generation (src_dir).\n* **Specify include directory:** The directory containing the include files (include_dir) must also be provided.\n* **Specify template directory:** Lastly, the directory with Jinja templates used for defining the classes (templates) needs to be specified.\n* **Run the generator:** Execute the provided command: `python3 gen.py --json schema.json --src_dir ../db --include_dir ../../include/odb --templates templates` to start the code generation process.\n* **Keep empty sections:** The tool removes empty sections from the output by default, but you can preserve them by running the generator with the `--keep_empty` flag.\n\n\nSources:\n"
