Similar to `write_pin_placement` option, is there a option to write macro placement position while using automatic macro placement.
So that macro position will be re-used for some specific requirement with manual macro placement again.

This is more of an issue than a discussion

@vijayank88 FYI, there's the `write_macro_placement` flag in mpl2. However it's currently deprecated due to a new OR command for general macro placement writing that was implemented in #4557.

I've opened #5046 to update the flag so that mpl2 will write the entire macro placement instead of only those macros that it placed.
