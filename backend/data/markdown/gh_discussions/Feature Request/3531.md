Is https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/tree/master/src/upf a work in progress (it doesn't have documentation). If it is, is it planned to have it supported?

UPF support is a work in progress.  The reader in upf/ works but the rest of the tool needs to support it.

### maliberty
I think the last remaining piece was pdn inserting the power switches.  @gadfort would you update on this?
