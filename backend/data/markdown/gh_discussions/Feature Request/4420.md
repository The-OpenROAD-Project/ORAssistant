# Report total number of paths vs. number of failing path

Tool: OpenSTA

Subcategory: Reporting enhancement

I was wondering if there was a way to quickly summarize the ratio between the number of paths and number of failing paths (with regard to timing) using OpenSTA. I know it can report the slack in each path in a detailled manner, but I would like to have a report in the vein of : "Here is the number of paths that the design has that needs to be tested for timing vs. the number of path that failed the test"

### maliberty
I don't see an easy way as the number of paths is exponential.  How would you use the result?

@tspyrou any thoughts?

### oharboe
@lustefan97 Could this be a use-case for timing histogram(supported in OpenROAD under Charts).

### maliberty
Note that to get the histograms you have to have qt charts installed.   During cmake you should get a message like "Charts widget is enabled" and not "Charts widget is not enabled"

It is a docking window the same as all the others and can be position wherever you like.

It is on by default, but qtcharts is not available for centos7 and so can't be assumed.

### oharboe
A less anaemic slack histogram example:

```
make DESIGN_CONFIG=designs/asap7/aes/config.mk cts
```

```
make DESIGN_CONFIG=designs/asap7/aes/config.mk gui_cts
```

@maliberty @oharboe Ok so I updated my OpenROAD to the latest version while having QT chart installed and enabled. After loading a database in that I knew had reported a slack, I tried to make a timing chart but resulted in the GUI crashing. 

I got a warning telling me that timing data was not stored  in the database and must be loaded separately if needed, are they not stored in the .odb ? Is the .odb file only "geometric" (would not be surprising since a .lef and .def files are needed), even if .lib files and RC rules have been used to produce the final result ?

### maliberty
@AcKoucher FYI

### oharboe
@AcKoucher Just one more example of where the horizontal labels are gone completely:

@oharboe @maliberty I have a quick but important question, right now I run my TCL scripts on a device that has no GUI, how would I need to proceed if I wanted to design a chip on it using OpenROAD but then move the results and generate the histogram on another computer (capable of opening a GUI).

I ran a test script in which I saved the design in a .odb file and the timing results from OpenSTA in a .sdf file, but when I loaded the .odb back in another GUI session (as well as the .sdf file using `read_sdf`), multiple warnings were raised during loading and no histogram was created...
