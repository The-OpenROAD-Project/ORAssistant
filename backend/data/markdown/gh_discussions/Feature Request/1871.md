# Support for MEOL layer?

Tool: OpenDB

Subcategory: Add MEOL layer support

Hello everyone!

I'm in the process of bringing up a new platform which is going well. I am running into a problem with a local interconnect layer which is specified as a `MASTERSLICE` with `LEF58_TYPE` = `MEOL`, so it is not specified as a `ROUTING` layer as is the case with the sky130 PDK. OpenDB complains that there is a parse mismatch for this `lil` layer.

If I add this `lil` layer as a routing layer to `make_tracks.tcl` then OpenDB complains that it is not a routing layer. If I don't add `lil` as a routing layer, then TritonRoute gives an error that it cannot find layer `lil` for viarule that connects `lil` to the first metal layer.

Did anyone else run into a similar problem? If so, how did you solve it?

Please include the odb message.  You should not add tracks if it is not a routing layer.

We need to add support for MEOL.  You can workaround it my making it a masterslice layer temporarily.
