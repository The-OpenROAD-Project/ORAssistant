This is in regard to [https://github.com/chipsalliance/ideas/blob/main/gsoc-2023-ideas.md#create-feol-classes-in-openroad-and-a-gds-writer](url), a GSoC project proposed in 2023. I would like to take this up for 2024's run of GSoC, and was **wondering what the project entails**. For reference, I have been contributing to OpenFASoC for a large part of the year and have good knowledge of their codebase, and some knowledge of OpenROAD-flow-scripts

@msaligane was the mentor in 2023 so it would be good to get his input.  I expect the hardest part would be dealing with hierarchy (aref/sref) as OR's odb is rather flat in its lef/def orientation.   New layers shouldn't be too hard.  The rest of the system will have to be more aware of them and the GUI will need some updating.

I would be good to have a specific use case beyond just read/write gds.  There should be some value added by doing it in OR as opposed to klayout or gdsfactory.

### stefanottili
Having openroad write gds/oas would be useful, because it reduces the file size compared to odb.

But I would recommend not to duplicate the ability to read and collect all the gds/oas pieces coming from various other sources. This functionality already exists in strm2oas.

### msaligane
We have been looking into this in the previous GSOC. Hopefully, this project gets approved for Chetanya to finish the project.
