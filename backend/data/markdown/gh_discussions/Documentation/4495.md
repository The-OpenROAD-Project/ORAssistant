# pad_left/right units for GPL and repair_clock_inverters description

Tool: Global Placement

I looked in OpenROAD documentation for Global Placement and Gate Resizer to get more detail about the units of the pad_left/right parameters of the `global_placement` command [(GPL)](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/tree/master/src/gpl) and the use/behavior of `repair_clock_inverters` [(RSZ).](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/blob/master/src/rsz/README.md) 

Both the variables units description is missing (while present for DPL (site count units), but since the two tools are different I don't want to assume it is the same for both) in GPL, and there is no description concerning `repair_clock_inverters` use case or behavior description (like there would be for `repair_timing` or `repair_design`.

What are the units of pad_left/right, and what does `repair_clock_inverters` do/how to use it ?

The units are sites from the LEF.

repair_clock_inverters is useful when you have an inverter in the clock tree that would split the tree.  It clones the inverter so you have one per flop instead.

before CTS see https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/blob/181e9133776117ea1b9f74dbacbfdaadff8c331b/flow/scripts/cts.tcl#L7
