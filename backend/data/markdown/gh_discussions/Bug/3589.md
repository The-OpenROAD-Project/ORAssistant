# how to fix metal spacing DRCs

After 64 iterations DRT stopped on my design a generated a DRC report. It turns out that most of the DRC are related to METAL1 spacing  (with net VSS) and Metal SpacingTableTw. The design is not very congested so I wonder why the tool could not fix these rules. Could it be that I am missing something here (maybe something in my platform definition)? Is there a way to fix these violations?

Can you provide a test case?

You have very wide METAL1 power stripes:

The pin is less than the min space (0.19 < 0.23) from the stripe so there is always going to be a DRC error here.   You need to adjust your PDN definition to be resolve this.
