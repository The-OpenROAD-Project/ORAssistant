This is for the top level of MegaBoom that I'm playing around with.

Is this warning telling me that it can't find a route for the buffer tree for the pin in the warning?

It looks like this buffer tree is going from the iregister_read macro to the ALUExeUnit, which traverses Rob(reorder buffer), rename stage and the memory issue unit. The mpl2 macro placement is unfortunate here...

@eder-matheus please respond

@oharboe @maliberty This warning is related to the estimate_parasitics using global route parasitics. It usually happens when a routing topology is not correctly translated to the parasitics estimation structures. I will look into the test case and fix the cause of this bug.
