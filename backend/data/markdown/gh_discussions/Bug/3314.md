I get a lot of these warnings when I run `make gui_final`

This is with the latest ORFS.

What are they?

```
$ make DESIGN_CONFIG=designs/asap7/mock-array-big/Element/config.mk place
```


```

@oharboe 
I ran with latest commit and not able to get similar logs.

### maliberty
The report says 'make place' and 'make gui_final' which are not a compatible pair.   I can't reproduce this either even running all the way through.

@maliberty Aha! This is a locale issue. In their wisdom a hundred years ago, Norwegians decided to use "," to separate integers from fractions in floating point... So "12.34" is not a valid float in Norwegian locale, rather "12,34" is.

The evidence that this is the problem is that setting `LC_NUMERIC="en_GB.UTF-8"` fixes the problem.

In this case, the locale is decided by the format that is being parsed, it is not a human readable/writeable number.

Let's see if this works: https://github.com/Pinata-Consulting/OpenSTA/tree/lock-down-strtof-locale

Yep :-)

This also explains why we don't see this when we run from docker, only local install.

### maliberty
Brazil has the same issue.  https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/blob/6920ac530b6959f742e75b7f55062b1642730b14/src/Main.cc#L217  attempts to solve this.  Do none of the locales exist on your systems?

### maliberty
Would you try your strtof check along with getlocale after these various points to try to see what's going on.  I think this works in Brazil so I'm trying to understand what's different here.  @luis201420 any insights?


### maliberty
Perhaps it relates to LC_NUMERIC or another.  Can you try unsetting all LC_* but LC_ALL in your environment to see if that matters?

### oharboe
@maliberty @luis201420 With this change, I no longer get the warnings.

This is just a quick hack, I think it would be better if someone who knows what is going on and are aware of other edgecases articulates the pull request :-)

### maliberty
@luis201420 will you look at this since you can reproduce it

### oharboe
I guess this has been identified as a bug in OpenROAD, given that there are frameworks that set the locale after OpenROAD has set the locale.
