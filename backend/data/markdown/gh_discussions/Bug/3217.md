What is detailed routing trying to do here? The grey area is a macro.

Is the detailed route simply spilling onto the macro because it can't find a valid place to put the wire?

Since no-one answers, I'm thinking I guessed right :-)

### maliberty
Most likely (assuming the layers are blocked and this isn't just available resource).
