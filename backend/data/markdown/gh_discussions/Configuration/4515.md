I need a cell that does not rotate in both global and detailed placement. Is there any way to achieve it? I did not find any parameter.

### maliberty
If it is a standard cell the LEF for the cell gives its symmetry.

As this isn't a usual use case it has been lower priority.  The simplest thing might be to just delete the rows that represent Y symmetry if you want to avoid such for your experiments.
