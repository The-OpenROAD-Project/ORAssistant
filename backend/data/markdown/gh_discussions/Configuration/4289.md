Hi all,

I am trying to load custom lef/lib files for pnr, and my lef files contain some properties unsupported by openroad. I got too much warning messages from this and the unsupported properties didn't have effect on my pnr results. Is there any way to disable the LEF warning messages temporarily? I checked the documents but failed to find an option that can turn off the warnings. Sorry if I missed it from the documents.

Thanks in advance!

There is no method to do that currently.  No single message will print more than 1k times.

@maliberty  Correct me if I am wrong, but doesn't Tcl function `suppress_message` do this? 

Edit: i guess there's no function that achieves full suppression for all warnings, what OP requested
