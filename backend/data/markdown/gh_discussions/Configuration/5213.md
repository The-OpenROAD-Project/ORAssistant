Hi all, I'm new to using ORFS and tried some tutorials from https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/micro2022tutorial.

Completing exercise 5 got this simple output:

From this, I'm trying to make a simple combinational circuit. Running make DESIGN_CONFIG=../../half_Adder/config.mk, it always ends at this error:

### maliberty
Please package this as a standalone test case and attach it.  Reproducing it from screen shots is inefficient.

[try.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15751707/try.zip)

Here's the  zip file along with the command : make DESIGN_CONFIG=../../try/config.mk


### mi-and-core
(1) change module name from 'half_adder' to 'halfAdder'


### maliberty
In the config.mk
```
export DESIGN_NAME = halfAdder
```
while in halfAdder.v:
```
module half_adder(
```
These names need to match.
