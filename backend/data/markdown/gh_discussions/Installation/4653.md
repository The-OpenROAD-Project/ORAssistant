I installed openroad on RHEL8 using the documentation from GitHub. After launching openroad -gui, I noticed that it mentions QtCharts is not installed. So I built and compiled it (from source qtcharts-everywhere-src-5.15.0.zip), and and it appears to have installed in /usr/include/qt5/QtCharts ..but when I launch openroad -gui again , it STILL says "QtCharts not installed" ..(see attachment) Any ideas on what to do ??  This doesn't appear to be very straightforward

Cmake does some caching so I suggest removing your build directory and re-running cmake to see if it then finds it.

### maliberty
Is the rest of Qt installed in the same area?
