# openRoad installation

I was successfully able to run cmake and then make. However, output of cmake has following two messages which seems problematic to me. How do I resolve these?

-- GUI is not enabled
-- Could NOT find VTune (missing: VTune_LIBRARIES VTune_INCLUDE_DIRS)

I ran following command
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/msingh/openRoad -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=$(python3 -c "import sysconfig; print(sysconfig.get_path('include'))") -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=$(python3 -c\
 "import sysconfig; print(sysconfig.get_config_var('LIBDIR'))")

I also ran make afterwards, which seems to finish. There are bunch of warnings but no error message. Where do I find the executable. I don't find it in CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin directory.

Does it mean that installation didn't complete? 

I am looking for some help because I am stuck in the installation.

I just cleared the buffer that has log, but I can redo those steps if you need the complete log output.

Vtune is unimportant unless you are a developer of OR.

The GUI suggests that you don't have Qt installed.  Did you run the dependency installer?

### msingh9
Thanks Maliberty for response.

I followed the steps "https://openroad-flow-scripts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/BuildLocally.html" and was able to build with hiccups. 
How do I make sure Qt is installed? BTW - I am trying to install it on Linux RH8. Is it supported platform?

When I try to invoke it, I get this missing library error.
openroad -help
openroad: error while loading shared libraries: libortools.so.9: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory


### maliberty
I don't know what OS you are on and you haven't included any logs.  If you look at https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/blob/master/etc/DependencyInstaller.sh it you'll see it references Qt libraries.

### msingh9
I am trying to build it on RH8. I am really stuck at this point now. I ran "sudo ./DependencyInstaller.sh" successfully. 

I can check that qt5 is installed.

[msingh@lnx-msingh cv6 /tmp]$ sudo yum -y install qt5-srpm-macros.noarch
Last metadata expiration check: 0:07:51 ago on Sun 12 Mar 2023 12:19:34 AM PST.
Package qt5-srpm-macros-5.12.5-3.el8.noarch is already installed.
Dependencies resolved.
Nothing to do.

When I run cmake to create build files, I get that "GUI is not enabled". Is there a switch I need to pass to cmake. Here is my command and it's output.

[msingh@lnx-msingh cv6 build]$ cmake .. -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/cv6/tools2/tv2/release/Python3/3.9.0/include/python3.9 -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/cv6/tools2/tv2/release/Python3/3.9.0/lib -Dortools_DIR=/opt/or-tools

### maliberty
What OS are you using?  Is qt in the default location?

### vijayank88
@msingh9 
Can you try docker based installation [steps](https://openroad-flow-scripts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/BuildWithDocker.html) ?

### msingh9
Thank you everyone for support. I finally managed to make it work on RH8. It is exciting to see this tool in action. I really like to appreciate everyone effort to make this open-source magic.  I will post my results once I can make it work.
