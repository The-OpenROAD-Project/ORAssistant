What does it mean and what should I do?

From latest https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/megaboom PDN

@gadfort any comments?

I see... Not an unfamiliar situation in EDA tools.... 

In C++ one can generally remove all warnings, not so in FPGA/EDA tools....

I going to forego filing a github issue on this case for now.
