I have "repair_design" to repair slew and cap, but this has been running for long time with no output. I think it is hanging. My design is not that big. I think it will be useful to get some sense of how much work has been completed, like work progress from these functions. Maybe I should file this a enhancement request? Is there a way to print some message while it is working?

### maliberty
You could file it as an enhancement request or try to tackle it yourself and file a PR.

@msingh9 
Are you using standalone OpenROAD or with OpenROAD-flow-scripts?

### maliberty
How large is your design?
