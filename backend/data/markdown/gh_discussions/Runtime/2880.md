Is it possible to run `estimate_parasitics -global_routing` on a post-global_route design that's been loaded via the `read_db` command? As in, `global_route` has been run on the design before it was saved with `write_db`, but `global_route` has not been run in this current OpenROAD session. I keep getting this error:

```
>>> read_db post_global_route
>>> estimate_parasitics -global_routing
[ERROR RSZ-0005] Run global_route before estimating parasitics for global routing.
```

@eder-matheus I thought this was possible.  Please comment

### maliberty
Are you using a very old version of OR for this?  The guides should be saved in the db.

### maliberty
OR improves a lot over time so it is a good practice to test with a current version when you find a problem.
