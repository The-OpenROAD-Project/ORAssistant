# Build times for our design

Tool: Detailed Routing

There is no question here, just a demonstration of the use of the build time summary for a design that has one top level macro and 5 macros at the top level. What is being built here are mock abstracts for the macros at the top level as we are only interested in regression testing the top level on our build servers.

The top level is the slowest in detailed routing and we have 5 macros at the top level.

We are not currently building the macros at the top level in parallel, though we intend to, but it would only cut the running time by 50%.

This is the command I run to build a summary of all the build times `find -regex ./logs/.*/base -type d -exec python3 util/genElapsedTime.py -d {} \; | sort -hr -k2`

### maliberty
That is average behaviour as drt is costly.  It does scale pretty well with threads so more CPUs helps.  We do have some work to do distributed drt if you want to test it out but it isn't in the flow currently due to the extra setup overhead.

### maliberty
How many threads in your data above?

### oharboe
No question or suggestions here, just a datapoint that I thought it might have some value in sharing.

### maliberty
Fwiw we test with 40 cpus and I know Google often uses 96.   We have tested with several hundred in distributed mode.
