I was running the riscv model with default setup. When I was trying to find wns for hold after the full run (or in cts, route). It is returning as INF.

Command:
```
report_worst_slack -min
```
Returns `worst slack INF`

**pdk:** asap7
**design:** riscv32i

Any idea why is that and how to solve it?

### maliberty
In which PDK?  How did you load the design?  Please give specific steps to reproduce the issue.

### maliberty
I guess you meant ```make gui_6_final.odb``` without the 'e'.  I get:

```
>>> report_worst_slack -min
worst slack 40.29
```

What commit id are you using for OR & ORFS?  This would have worked better as an issue with the required info.
