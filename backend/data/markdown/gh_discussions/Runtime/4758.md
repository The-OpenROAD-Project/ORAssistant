### oharboe
Is the "rebuffer" buffer superfluous here?

The "rebuffer" buffer does not exist in placement, only after CTS.

### maliberty
It is there for timing optimization as the path has negative slack which is addressed post-CTS.  Is there a reason to think it superfluous?

### oharboe
No extra buffers after removing `set_load -pin_load 10 [all_outputs]`:

Set don't touch after the output buffer is created.

> If I delete set_load -pin_load 10 [all_outputs], the extra buffer goes away.

Probably the timing improves and the net no longer needs repair.  Similarly with the set_driving_cell changing the timing.
