I am using a custom macro placement script. Changing the macro position from default to any other formation causing error in detailed routing. 

`[ERROR DRT-0255] Maze Route cannot find path of net (some net) in worker of routeBox (34000 75000) (41000 45000)`

Is it an algorithm error, any idea?


### vijayank88
Is automatic macro placement creating that error?

### maliberty
This is a problem in detailed routing that would require a test case to investigate.  Can you provide one?

### maliberty
I don't expect this error from the router even with a bad macro placement.

### msingh9
How do you do custom macro placement?

### maliberty
It would be great to have a test case for this problem as is so we can fix it in addition to any workarounds in placement to avoid it.
