What does this error message mean?

@eder-matheus please respond

### eder-matheus
@oharboe That means the guides don't cover at least one pin of this net. I will update this error message to clarify what pin is not covered.
Could you share what commit you are using in this run? This error should not be happening at all and could be a side effect of an update I've made.

### oharboe
I don't recall the details, but this was fixed on master.
