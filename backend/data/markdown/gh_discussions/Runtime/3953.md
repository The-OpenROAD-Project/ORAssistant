Run `make designs/nangate45/gcd/config.mk &&  make designs/nangate45/gcd/config.mk gui_final` and enable placement heat map.

This looks odd. There is less going on in the top and right edges, but it still "looks wrong" to me.

Thoughts?

It does look a bit odd.  @AcKoucher can you take a look?

### AcKoucher
With nets being draw it's a bit hard to see. I just ran master in nangate45/gcd and as far as I see, everything looks ok.

I just realized in the discussion name it says Placement Density, but in your image we see Routing Congestion.
