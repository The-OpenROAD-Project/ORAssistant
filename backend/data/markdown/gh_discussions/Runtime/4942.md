@oharboe 
I came across your test case https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/blob/master/src/pdn/test/macros_cells_not_fixed.ok
I am also facing similar error with `macro_placement` command followed by PDN stage throws error.
```
[WARNING PDN-0234] spm_inst_0 has not been placed and fixed.
[WARNING PDN-0234] spm_inst_1 has not been placed and fixed.
[ERROR PDN-0235] Design has unplaced macros.
PDN-0235
```
How to resolve this error?
Thanks in advance...

@maliberty @vijayank88 I dont recall making this test case...

@vijayank88 it means you have macros in your design that have not been placed. PDN will only consider placed and locked macros and therefore requires all macros to be locked. Look at your design to find the two macros that have not been placed and locked and fix that
