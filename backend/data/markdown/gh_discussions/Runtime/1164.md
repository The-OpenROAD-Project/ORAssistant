Hi,

I am trying to run OpenROAD/src/ICeWall/test examples. Used below command inside openroad and stopped with error

openroad 1> source soc_bsg_black_parrot_nangate45.tcl 
[WARNING ODB-0229] Error: library (NangateOpenCellLibrary.mod) already exists
[WARNING ODB-0229] Error: library (dummy_pads) already exists
[WARNING STA-0053] dummy_pads.lib line 7, library dummy_pads_worst_case already exists.
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

Anyone can explain how to run this flow and to view DEF file klayout to view my chip level io connection created by ICeWall

Thanks in advance
