Hi, guys

After reading the paper and browsing the source codes, I cannot figure out which parts of the codes reflect the local density penalty described in the paper, could you please suggest where can I find that in the implementation?

Thanks a lot for the nice work.

Bo

@mgwoo can you answer this?

A method related density computation seems to be removed in the CL https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/commit/0f82f83049733938c2fb5d6141b291409aa4678f , in which the original design calls updateDensityForceBin inside NesterovPlace::doNesterovPlace. (not sure if this can be related)

@ahmadelrouby could you help understand the changes? thanks

I didn't decipher the local density features because of unstable issues. 
Please check the standalone repo for the local density calculation:  https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/RePlAce/blob/7c07cffdf419c4dbd315c73c235ec5d670fb0240/src/ns.cpp#L1011
