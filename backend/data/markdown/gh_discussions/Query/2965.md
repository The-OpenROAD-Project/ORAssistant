Hi everybody,

I already build OpenROAD GUI to run on Ubuntu Linux. Now I'm looking for a sample project that can open directly via main menu `File > Open DB` in OpenROAD GUI (like the below image), I have spent a lot of time to find the way (reading read-me, watching video, etc) to do it, but I did not complete.
I found a data test at https://github.com/TILOS-AI-Institute/MacroPlacement/tree/main/Flows/NanGate45/ariane133 but seems it cannot open directly by OpenROAD and maybe need to do several pre-processing steps before can open in OpenROAD GUI.
Could you please help me to know how to do it or give me detail instructions to open this test data in the OpenROAD GUI?
Thanks.

Hi @vic4key,

It's not clear what's failing, and what you would like to see? It would also be helpful if you uploaded the data you could upload your test data in a zip folder and post it here. So that we can debug th issue.

@vic4key 
Same design implemented in OpenROAD-flow-scripts. https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/tree/master/flow/designs/nangate45/ariane136
All you need to install OpenROAD-flow-scripts and run the design and view it in OpenROAD GUI.
Installation document available here: https://openroad-flow-scripts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/BuildLocally.html

cuda will make almost no difference to runtime.  I would start by running gcd as it is the smallest test case.
