### AayushiRV
I am inserting buffers to my design. How can I find that buffers are being inserted? I cannot find anything in my design's netlist.

### maliberty
How are you inserting the buffers?

### maliberty
There is no such command in OR:
```
openroad> insert_buffer
invalid command name "insert_buffer"
while evaluating insert_buffer
```

@AayushiRV 
`insert_buffer` is maintained by OpenLane. Check this example: https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane/blob/master/tests/1007/interactive.tcl
So OpenROAD nothing to do with that.
