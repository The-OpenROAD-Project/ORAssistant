I'm running OpenROAD v2.0-8374-g5235ee26c, but I can't find the endpoint slack histogram. I thought it would be in the Windows menu...

Do you have Qt5 charts installed? Your CMake log should have:
```
-- Charts widget is enabled
```
It requires a new optional dependency. On Ubuntu you should be able to do `apt install libqt5charts5-dev`.

Very cool!

Some nits:

No legend on horizontal axis and I have to undock it and increase the size to see what's going on(no numbers visible when it is a tiny chartlet in the default position).

Also, I think the scripting window could leave space for the vertical column where the timing report is, instead of taking the full width of the window.
