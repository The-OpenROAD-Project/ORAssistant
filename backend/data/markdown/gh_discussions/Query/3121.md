I am using https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/TritonRoute to run the benchmarks of ispd2018&2019. However I found Multithreaded acceleration is almost useless.  Does the legacy code in https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/TritonRoute support Multithreaded acceleration ?

### maliberty
How are you enabling the multi threading? It should make a large difference

### maliberty
The standalone TritonRoute is archived and not under any active development or support.  If that meets you needs that's fine but the integrated version in OR is continuing to be improved.

### maliberty
Since you are interested in contests I would look at 
https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/blob/master/src/drt/test/ispd18_sample.tcl
https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/blob/master/src/drt/test/run-ispd.py

as examples
