I have a timing path in the OpenROAD GUI that I want to understand.

How can I go from the timing report in the GUI to the Verilog?

### maliberty
https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/pull/1129 should help with naming once merged.

There is no direct link today so you'll have to work back from the names.  @QuantamHD has some work to store line numbers that is hopefully going to land but has been tied up in OSS licensing issues.

@maliberty Here is an example of how it is hard to get from the static timing report to the Verilog:

Build the design with ` make DESIGN_CONFIG=designs/asap7/mock-array-big/config.mk`, then look at the Element `make DESIGN_CONFIG=designs/asap7/mock-array-big/Element/config.mk gui_final`.

How, in general, do I find my way to the Verilog code?

### maliberty
If you use the rename PR I mentioned then the register should have a name matching the Element.v to some degree.  Does that work here?

What I've heard is that tracking from timing reports back to RTL is an "unsolved problem in EDA tools", so https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/pull/1129 is probably as good as it gets for now.

To go beyond this, I suppose Yosys has to grow some sophistication w.r.t. tracking back to the original Verilog.

One of the goals of https://circt.llvm.org/ is to provide an improved infrastructure for RTL as it goes through a number of tools in a flow. Perhaps, one day, yosys will support https://circt.llvm.org/. Ideally this would give Yosys more input languages and better "debug information" through synthesis and technology mapping...
