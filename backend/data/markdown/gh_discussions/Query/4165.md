My apologies if this is an obvious question. I am working with a fab trying to develop a new process that currently has 2 metal layers, and we were wondering if we could use OpenROAD/OpenLANE to build test chips. I was unable to find an answer in the documentation, but if it is there I would love to know where to look. Thank you for your help!

In theory we could route in two layers but we've never tried it.  We don't have a specialized channel router.  My expectation is that we will hit some issues and have to iterate.  If the PDK is closed it will be harder to do so.

I'm sure that Fastroute and TritonRoute are capable of routing on two layers.
