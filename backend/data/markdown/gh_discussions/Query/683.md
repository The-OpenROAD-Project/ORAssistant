# What's the workflow of developing in submodules?

I git clone --recursive the parent repo "openroad-flow-scripts" so I get all the code including submodules in the local. 
And then I use "git remote rename origin upstream" and "git remote add origin <my_new_created_blank_openroad-flow.git> to let it point to my repo. (I only create one repo for the openroad-flow-script. I didn't create repo for submodules.)
After I made changes in submodule /tools/openroad/src, I do git `add` and `commit` in the directory of submodule tools/openroad, and then in the parent directory /openroad-flow-scripts, I do `git add tools/openroad`, `commit`, `push`. I can see it does push something to somewhere[![push result](https://i.postimg.cc/jSrTz9Ry/We-Chat-Image-20210526015324.png)](https://postimg.cc/kBwLCT65), but I cannot find it on github.com, on which the directory url points to 404 [![404page](https://i.postimg.cc/FF3DfsHF/404.png)](https://postimg.cc/fkWxpsd1)page. I am wondering where the submodules go when I do the `git remote add origin <my_openroad-flow.git>`. Is there a way to create the submodule repo automatically in my repo?

It isn't clear in which repo you are runing which steps.  Please give a specific set of steps to replay to see your problem.

I think the simplest is to fork ORFS & OR.

### maliberty
When the submodule is checked out it will be a specific commit that is checked out not the HEAD.  You can just 'it checkout master' and commit your change.  Then in ORFS you can update the submodule to point to your new commit.

### maliberty
In ORFS you should see that the submodule is modified and you git add/commit it as usual.

### maliberty
yes

When I want to get the update of submodules, I do `git pull --recurse-submodule`, [![gitpullsubmodulecheckout.png](https://i.postimg.cc/hPpJ5z1G/gitpullsubmodulecheckout.png)](https://postimg.cc/svGDB28F),
but it checkouts the commit id it originally points to. [![submodulepointtocommit.png](https://i.postimg.cc/5tF6yPdH/submodulepointtocommit.png)](https://postimg.cc/Y4MpyzSk).
How to let it point to my OR git master branch? Otherwise, I need to go into that submodule directory to do the `git checkout master` every time.
