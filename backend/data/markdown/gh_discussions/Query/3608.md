# How do I find and view the nets that are causing hold and setup violations?

It want to find and view nets that cause hold violations.

Today I have to wait and hope for a global routing failure to be able to view the nets that cause hold violations in DRC viewer there.

```
Repair setup and hold violations...
TNS end percent 5
[INFO RSZ-0041] Resized 2 instances.
[WARNING RSZ-0062] Unable to repair all setup violations.
[INFO RSZ-0046] Found 2957 endpoints with hold violations.
[INFO RSZ-0032] Inserted 40106 hold buffers.
Placement Analysis
```

```tcl
find_timing_paths -path_delay min -slack_max 0
```
@oharboe, Would this work for you?
Note that RSZ just said it had found `2957` hold violations; after inserting the `40106` buffers, there's no warning.
So it is likely that all have been fixed -- see the warning in the line above for a contrast about setup violations.

For setup you would do:
```tcl
find_timing_paths -path_delay max -slack_max 0
```

### oharboe
Found an approach... Here is what I did:

1. create some hold failures by reducing the clock period from 2000 to 1000ps in mock-array, using diff below.
2. There are no timing violations in placement, the timing violations happen after CTS.
3. Modify cts.tcl to write out an ODB file *before* hold cells are inserted and the design is repair. Post repair in CTS there are no violations.

Now I can run commands to examine minimum hold time violations, which will lead to hold cells being inserted.

### oharboe
`make gui_cts` ctrl-f and searching for instance `*hold*` is helpful. :-)

From there I can go to the buffer tree, then find the endpoints.
