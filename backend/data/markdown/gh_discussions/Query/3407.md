How can I trace global routing congestion to the net that is causing the problem?

I have routing congestion on top of my macro, but I'm struggling to find out which net is causing the problem.

I *think* the problem is that some pin is on the wrong side of the macro and that a net is being routed around the macro.

Clicking on the routing congestion doesn't leave me with much of a clue to track down the net that is causing the problem:

Short term I would select all nets and see if you can spot the one crossing the macro.  Then go to one end and see what pin it is coming from

@eder-matheus @luis201420 can we add the set of nets in the gcell to the congestion marker?

Some tips and some ideas for new features to improve this experience, so I think this is answered.
