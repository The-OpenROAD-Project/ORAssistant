If ran openroad without gui, can I bring gui on later on after few steps from flow.tcl? I could save the design db and then open that design in gui, but I am just wondering if I can bring gui on from within openroad prompt.

1) openroad -log log
2) source <my_design>.tcl
3) After few steps of flow
4) I want to open the design in gui

You can open the gui at anytime with `gui::show`

### msingh9
This works like a charm. Thank you for comment.

FYI you can go the other way with "Hide GUI":
