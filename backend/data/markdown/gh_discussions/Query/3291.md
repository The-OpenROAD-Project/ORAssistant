I've found myself ignoring warnings when I shouldn't...

In that regard, it would be helpful to fix some warnings that are always there, so I pay more attention...

Can these be fixed?

```

They cannot, the warnings are due to the structure of the cells in the PDK and the way they were characterized into a timing model. You can, however, stop the warnings from showing up by using `suppress_message STA 164`.

I have discussed about this `WARNING STA-016` month back with Tom. Replied:
```
The output to output timing edges in the liberty cause this warning.
If it's just this one cell, you could add it to the don't use list. 
I think this warning means the timing will be less accurate.
If you are doing experiments it may also be safe to ignore.
```
