Is there any way to generate a report for max cap, max fanout and max slew after “repair_design” is applied?

### maliberty
If you are using ORFS then we already do that in 3_4_place_resized.log.  If any flow you can insert the relevant commands.

### AayushiRV
I am not using ORFS.

### maliberty
You can add ``` report_check_types -max_slew -max_capacitance -max_fanout``` to whatever you are using then

### AayushiRV
OK, I am using this, if after using this command nothing is shown does that means all the violations are cleared?
