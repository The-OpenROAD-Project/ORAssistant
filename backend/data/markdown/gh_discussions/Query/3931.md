# about the meaning of frBlockObjectEnum

Subcategory: Code understanding

## Conversation

### gilgamsh
in src/frBaseTypes.h , there is a enum class called frBlockObjectEnum, and it has lots of types. I want to know the prefix meanings. Such as `frc`,`drc`,`tac`,`gcc`

### maliberty
The c is for constant.  fr = base types, dr = detailed router, ta = track assignment, gc = drc  (these correspond to the subdirs of src/).


### gilgamsh
Thank you very much
