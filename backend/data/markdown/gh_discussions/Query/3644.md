```c++
// master setting
dbMaster *master = dbMaster::create(db_lib, lib_cell_name.c_str());
master->setWidth(width);
master->setHeight(height);
master->setType(dbMasterType::CORE);
...
master->setFrozen();
// connect inst to the master
    
dbInst* inst = dbInst::create(db_block, master, instance_info->inst_name.c_str());

// now I want to change the size of inst, by unfrozen master and resize width and height
// Is my intention of the below pseudo-code possible?
master->setUnFrozen();
master->setWidth(new_width);
master->setHeight(new_height);
master->setFrozen();
```

**I would like to know whether the above pseudo-code is possible.**

**I want to resize the cell size** after the cell size is already determined. (For example, after parsing lef and def).
But it seems like not to exist function for unfreezing.

If I want to change the cell size, then should I 
1. re-construct the instance,
2. re-construct the new dbMaster, 
3. deleting the original instance, 
4. and re-connecting the new dbInst to the nets, which was connected with the original one?

I would like to know whether **is there another way, which is more simple**.


Thanks for the time for reading my question.

Sincerely.

Why are you freezing it in the first place?

### maliberty
setWidth & setHeight don't care about the frozen status afaik.  The key thing is that the port list is frozen.  You can't add a dbMTerm to a frozen master.
