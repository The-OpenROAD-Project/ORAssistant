# About routing constant values to VDD/VSS power rails

Is there any way to route logical constant 1 & 0 to Vdd & Vss power rails instead of using tie cells? Right now I'm using a cell with short circuit between output and power pins, which is really bad in terms of area.

### maliberty
No there is no facility for that.  The supply rails are often noisy and the tie cell provides a more stable output.  What is the issue with using a tie cell?

### stefanottili
Constant propagation should be able to remove all constants unless they're connected to ram/rom/pad/analog macro's, no ?
Which synthesis tool has been used to create the netlist ?
Can yosys do constant propagation ? If so, is it on by default or does it need to be enabled ?
