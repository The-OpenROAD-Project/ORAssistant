# Running times in detailed routing as a function of design parameters

Tool: Detailed Routing

Subcategory: Performance analysis

## Conversation

### oharboe
mock-array-big has 3 essential parameters that can be adjusted: array area(number of elements), element size (area) and data width (bits).

I thought it would be interesting to see how detailed routing (TritonRoute) varies across these parameters, so I made a python snippet(https://github.com/Pinata-Consulting/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/commits/plot-running-times) to gather some data and plot them

The graph below is interactive(measured on a machine with 16 threads and 64gByte of RAM, where memory consumption appears to peak at 20gByte), which helps in terms of understanding the 4 dimensions being represented:

**8 x 8 64 bit array detailed route times plotted against threads**

**Conclusion so far**

Detailed routing is surprisingly slow when the area is large, but everything else is the same.

This run takes 40 minutes or so, `APTOS_MOCK_PITCH_SCALE=20 make FLOW_VARIANT=scale-20 route DESIGN_CONFIG=designs/asap7/mock-array-big/config.mk` whereas `APTOS_MOCK_PITCH_SCALE=2 make FLOW_VARIANT=scale-2 DESIGN_CONFIG=designs/asap7/mock-array-big/config.mk` completes in a few minutes


**Detailed of testing...**

It looks like the performance of detailed routing is sensitive to area:

```
MOCK_ARRAY_PITCH_SCALE=2 make OPENROAD_EXE="perf record -o perf.data ~/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/tools/install/OpenROAD/bin/openroad" DESIGN_CONFIG=designs/asap7/mock-array-big/config.mk FLOW_VARIANT=scale-2 route
```

```

### maliberty
How many threads in your experiment? 

### oharboe
@rovinski I would not have guessed that the *area* of the design is what really drives up the time of detailed routing.


### maliberty
The area of the design will definitely matter.   You will have tracks at the same pitch and have to traverse more of them during routing a larger area.

### maliberty
Rather than plot "detailed route times plotted against threads" it is usually easier to look at speedup (t(1)/t(N)) vs threads.  It makes it clearer how close to ideal scaling you are getting (the 45 degree line is perfect).

### oharboe
@maliberty @rovinski I fixed the image for the 1000x1000um when I took a snapshot. I accidentally used the small macro, the spacing between the macros should be very short, nearly abutment.

### oharboe
It looks like the expected behavior is that the 0th and the 1st iteration will take a long time for top level designs with lots of wires and little contention, even if these routes are horizontal and vertical and that the low hanging fruit has already been picked.

### binsa7261
wow this looks very impressive, bravo!

### v11sman
I learned a lot of interesting things
