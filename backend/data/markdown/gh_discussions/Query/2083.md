Hi, There is any way to contribute to the openRoad project?

### QuantamHD
They accepted code changes through PRs.

Is there something you are interested in working on? 

### maliberty
We are glad to have contributors.  Do you want some suggestions or do you have something in mind?

### maliberty
To help narrow it a bit are you more interested in development, testing, documentation, outreach?  If you are willing to share a bit about yourself it would help to find a task of appropriate complexity.

On the development side one idea that comes to mind is to improve write_abstract_lef written by @QuantamHD to give more precise obstructions.  I can describe that further if it is of interest.

### maliberty
The LEF abstract is a physical model of a block that is intended to be used at a higher level in the hierarchy to model the interface and obstructions in the block.  The current code starts from https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/blob/c4a8479c341c31fd0db26a17f4a909f59285cf58/src/odb/src/lefout/lefout.cpp#L1213

The current code is rather simplistic in its modeling of obstructions.  If you look at lefout::getTechLayerObstructions it just gathers a set of layers that have any shapes on them and then blocks the entire layer.

I think it would be better to use Boost polygon to OR together the shapes on each layer; do a bloat then shrink cycle to merge them into simpler shapes and then write out the result as the layer obstruction.  The amount of bloating could be a user control with a reasonable default (say 2*pitch). 

The goal is to balance model size with precision.   Does this make sense?  I can go into more detail where needed.

### stefanottili
Please keep in mind that there are two types of abstracts used by $$$ tools. The “cutout” where obstructions are cut out around pins and the “cover everything” where the pins are at the edges and the block is completely covered with obstruction. For the latter to work, the router has to be smart enough to route to covered pins and drc has to know that covered pins on the edge are ok too. It’s good practice to have pins on the edge of blocks anyways.

### maliberty
You can see gcd_abstract* in https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/tree/master/src/odb/test for two examples.  

The idea of the bloat/shrink cycle is to merge nearby shapes.  I've tried to quickly illustrate it with:

You can learn about Boost polygon at https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_79_0/libs/polygon/doc/index.htm  (the docs aren't great).

The red boxes in the middle image merge together into a single polygon

Hi, I will love to get some help in 2 issues.
First I will need to import to boost::polygon library, in which file can I do it? Do other part of the code already import it?

Second, I having trouble to understand how can I test my change, I gather all the shapes into kind of list and I now write it into the lef file instead the whole block boundary bbox, but I probably got some mistake so I want to run some test to debug it.
There is any tutorial how can I do it? 

### niv280
Hi, So I make some progress with the abstract lef.
But I encounter on some problem that I would like to get some help.

So I modify the abstract lef that in order to write the merge between all the rect that intersect ( after bloat ).
To demonstrate it I edit the picture from above:

The green rect is currently my OBS which isn't very efficient, but i didn't found any easy way to do it with the utils in the rect class.

So I am guessing that I need to go back to your first suggestion which is use boost polygon to OR all the rect, my problem is that is after that I will need to convert it back into different rects, there is any easy way to do that?

Have a look at get_rectangles and get_max_rectangles

get_rectangles  would be the better choice as get_max_rectangles may produce overlapping rectangles.  You an experiment with the slicing direction to see what produces a more minimal result.  My guess is the non-preferred routing direction will work best.
