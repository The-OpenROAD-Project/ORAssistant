Silly question...

```
>>> report_checks -path_delay max -through [get_pins foo*] -format full_clock_expanded -fields {net slew cap}
Startpoint: yyy (positive level-sensitive latch clocked by clock)
Endpoint: zzz (output port clocked by clock)
Path Group: clock
Path Type: max

Fanout     Cap    Slew   Delay    Time   Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          0.00    0.00   clock clock (rise edge)
                          0.00    0.00   clock source latency
                  0.00    0.00    0.00 ^ clock (in)

### maliberty
I think you want to resolve "positive level-sensitive latch" first.  I think it relates to latch transparency.

Fixed in #3762
