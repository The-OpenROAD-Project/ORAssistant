I would like to temporarily suppress some warnings like `[WARNING STA-0122]`. Is there a way to do that? Is there a place to look for the full meaning of warnings and error messages? Some of them are cryptic. 

### maliberty
There is no suppression mechanism.  There is no catalog of messages though you can always look at the source code to get more ideas.  Is there a particular message that you are finding cryptic?

### maliberty
I forgot we had that.  I wrote it with unit tests in mind but I guess it works here too.
