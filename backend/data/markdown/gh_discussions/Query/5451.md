How do you dump detailed cell usage statistics from a finished database?

I have the cell stats from the yosys synth run but want similar data from the timing closed routed db. 

Thanks

`report_cell_usage` is the simplest

https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/pull/5455 is quick stab at this.  What do you think of https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/pull/5455/files#diff-2da4a6ba84e5e60ce2a822063c4acd592ca2c6fc35f81f3d3d966f78ba7e1675 ?
