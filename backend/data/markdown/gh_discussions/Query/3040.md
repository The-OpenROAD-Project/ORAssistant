# Can I import yosys netlists in the openroad GUI and examine timing?

I realize this is an open ended question: How can I import Yosys netlists into OpenROAD and identify any timing concerns in the design?

Is there any documentation, tutorials or examples I can look at?

I think I have seen an ability to select interesting paths and drill down using "select" (yosys command? opensta command?) and filter timing paths, but I don't recall where.

Ideally using ORFS.

This would be more convenient than invoking yosys + open sta directly and interacting with the shell in either.

You can use 'make gui_floorplan' to open the results after the floorplan step which is pretty quick.  We could add an way to directly load the yosys output.  In either case you won't see any layout as nothing has been placed but you can use the usual timing path viewer.

You can't use yosys commands in OR as they are different tools.

### maliberty
In the GUI from Windows->Timing Report you can get the path viewer.  When you select items in the path viewer you can see them in the inspector if you need to get more physical/netlist details.

### maliberty
@vijayank88 are there any tutorials for timing debug?

@oharboe 
Only after placement you can trace timing path in OpenROAD gui.
You can refer `logs/nangate45/gcd/base/2_1_floorplan.log` (gcd example). It is the first OpenSTA timing report post synthesis.


### maliberty
You can really only do back annotation after you reach a fully routed result.  There is nothing to back annotate before that.  That is already supported in ORFS and the make gui_final will load the parasitics automatically.

You can generate timing report at any step of the flow.  Pre-placement you will get wire load models.  Later in the flow we use estimate_parasitics with -placement (after CTS) or -global_routing (after global routing).  Post-routing we use rcx extracted values.

Yosys 'schematics' are a capability of yosys and have nothing to do with OR.  The timing report already contains a list of all the cells/ports/nets so a schematic doesn't add much for a path.  In general generating schematics for arbitrary chunks of logic is hard and is essentially another P&R problem itself.  Even the proprietary tools aren't great at this beyond a small amount of logic.

If you have layout you can use the inspector to look at an ITerm and there are buttons to show the fanin and fanout cones

Here is a tightly package cone on gcd:

### maliberty
@oharboe is this sufficient info or do you need something more?

### oharboe
Will open new more specific questions in the future as needed. This was helpful to improve our understanding meanwhile.
