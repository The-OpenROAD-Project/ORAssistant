How do I get the power for each Instance？I have no power report after reading the odb file in gui.

### maliberty
```report_power -instances [get_cells *]``` should do it.  

### b224hisl
can I get the power of each module?

### maliberty
There is no per-module report today.  If you can express what you want in terms of instance names you could do something like `report_power -instances [get_cells a/b/*]`

### maliberty
get_cells comes from SDC where a 'cell' is another (poor) name for an instance.
