Why are these used in combination?

What happens if I don't?

https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/discussions/4529 has an fMax of 125, which isn't enormously impressive. There are 79 levels of logic in the longest path, which indicates to me that something isn't being optimized in synthesis...

BOOMv documents that it relies heavily on [register retiming](https://docs.boom-core.org/en/latest/sections/physical-realization.html#physical-realization) and I've also observed that it needs [register cloning](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/discussions/4522#discussioncomment-8106429) for synchronous reset.

Hence, I want to try disabling hierarchical synthesis on MegaBoom, but given the long turnaround times, 40 hours, it would be nice to know a little bit about what I'm doing and what I should expect...

I believe that RTLMP requires hierarchy in the netlist to work at all. If the netlist is flat, RTLMP won't work.

> At least no public tests. We would have to run the private ones as well.

@oharboe the retiming doesn't work in Yosys (and not in OpenROAD), so that is going to be a limitation. We ran into this as well with something else from the Chisel team folks and there isn't a good solution at the moment
