# OpenROAD Build From Sources

Subcategory: Compilation error

Hello Guys,

I am using ArchLinux and I have been using OpenROAD from an install package from the AUR. 
This install does not seem to work anymore (it was working on my setup a couple of weeks ago).

So I am trying to build from sources but I get the same errors as I get with the AUR package:
```

Seems to be something related to Swig with TCL. Does anybody know what the problem is?

Thanks for your help



### maliberty
What version of TCL and swig do you have installed?

### maliberty
Perhaps something is different in 4.2.1 as with 4.1.0 I don't see any used of Tcl_Size in tclSwig.h.  Is it possible for you to downgrade?

### stefanottili
Does anybody know how to downgrade swig on MacOS M1 homebrew ?
The current SWIG Version 4.2.1 causes the same error here.
Can be worked around by commenting out the two offending lines, they seem to be in an error path ...
