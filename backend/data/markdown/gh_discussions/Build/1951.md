# Is it possible to generate a static binary of OpenROAD?

Hi all, I am trying to execute the OpenROAD in a cluster machine. However, in this machine, I am not able to install the dependencies to compile the OpenROAD or even use the docker image to run the OpenROAD.

I was wondering if it is possible to set a cmake flag to generate a static binary (without any dependencies) for the OpenROAD project. With this, I will be able to run this binary on every machine that I need.

Does someone know how to do this?

@vvbandeira  Any suggestion?

Bazel rules hdl supports fully static builds of openroad.

Just download bazel, git clone https://github.com/hdl/bazel_rules_hdl

And run bazel build @org_theopenroadproject//:openroad in the git repo. 

It also statically builds the entire dependency chain of openroad from source.
