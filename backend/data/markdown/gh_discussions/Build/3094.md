What's going on here?

Hmm.... I suspect a manifestation of https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/issues/3096

The problem is that the first download failed, and the file was not correctly deleted.

New download:
```
boost_1_80_0.tar.gz 100%[===================>] 130,34M  2,37MB/s    in 65s
```

Saving with the `.1` suffix:
```
2023-03-27 16:56:06 (2,02 MB/s) - ‘boost_1_80_0.tar.gz.1’ saved [136670223/136670223]
```

Checking against the file without the suffix:
```
+ md5sum -c /dev/fd/63
++ echo '077f074743ea7b0cb49c6ed43953ae95  boost_1_80_0.tar.gz'
```

I will propose a PR that uses `mktemp` that should avoid this and the #3096 issues. You can manually delete the folder/offending file for now -- apologies for the inconvenience.
