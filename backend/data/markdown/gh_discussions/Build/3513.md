There has been a lot of activity concerning build errors, but I tried with latest master merged with #3512

Is it enough to update to latest master or do I need to purge something or other locally?

```
./build_openroad.sh --local --openroad-args "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-g"
```

```

This ones my bad. It seems that some installations of libgtest-dev don't include google mock. If you uninstall your system gtest it will fix this error, but I'll see if there's something else we could do to fix this.

Fixed on #3514
