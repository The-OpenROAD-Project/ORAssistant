I am trying to build Openroad with cmake .. -DGPU=true and I get the following output

I have Cuda installed and on `nvidia-smi` I get

Any help on how to get the setup working is really appreciated and thanks in advanced.







### vvbandeira
Please install a newer version of `nvcc` and try again. As per NVIDIA docs, you will require at least v11; see more [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#c-17-language-features).

### maliberty
If we bump to cmake 3.10 then https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindCUDA.html suggests we can use the usual VERSION keyword.

FYI - the use of CUDA is quite minimal and probably not worth the bother at this point.
