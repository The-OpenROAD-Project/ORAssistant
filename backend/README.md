# Backend For ORAssistant

This folder contains the backend code for the ORAssistant. Follow the instructions below to set up the environment and run the backend.

## Preparing the Environment Variables

To configure the application, you'll need to set up the environment variables in your `.env` file:

The given command would copy the template for environment variables to a local `.env` file 


```
cp .env.example .env
```


### Setting Up Google API Key and Credentials Variables

There are 2 variables that needs to be set up

- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

This key is used to access the various google cloud functions.
  - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
  - Create new project or select existing one
  - Enable required APIs:
       - Google Gemini API
       - Vertex AI API
  - Go to APIs & Services > Credentials
  - Click "Create Credentials" > "API Key"
  - Copy the generated key and it to the `.env` file
  
- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
  Since most of the GCP functions / services would be used by our app, we need to have a special credential that would allow `ORAssistant`'s access to the GCP
    Steps to set up Service Account Credentials:
  - In Google Cloud Console, go to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts
  - Click "Create Service Account"
  Fill in service account details
  -  Grant required roles:
       - Vertex AI User
       - Vertex AI Service Agent
  - Create key (JSON format)
  - Download JSON file
  - Store securely and add path to .env:
       `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/credentials.json`

**NOTE**: The user might need billing to be set up on google cloud account and make sure to name the file as `credentials.json`  as this would be ignored by `.git` and wouldn't be exposed on Github
